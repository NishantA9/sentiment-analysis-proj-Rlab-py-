How to run -

2) select line 28 and 29 and run
what does corpus does
in text analytics corpus is used for the list of different documetns
(here doc is reviews) and iconv is - it translates value labels into a specific
encoding that is used for text analytics and then passing in vector source 
to create a corpus

3) from 31 till 44 run every line

4) skip line 47,48,49 it will be used later

5) run 51 tgeb 52 and then 54

6) run 57 to 60
 here termdocument matrix is uesd and we pass the corpus the refined corpus in it

7) run line 65
next we are summing up all the values in the rows to get actual no of occureance 
where we take a subset whose occurance would be >= 25

8) now run line 48 then line 54 - 68

9) run line 71

10) now run 86 - 88

so get nrc sentiment gives metrics where row represents each review
 and col represent emotions

11) run 90 and 95 (note change the final scores csv file or rename it)

12) run the final lines 
now we will check overall product sentiment by summing up the cols and all

the last graph bar shows that the following book has positive reviews
and trust factor is good
